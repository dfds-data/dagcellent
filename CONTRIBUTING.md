# Build system
[üê£ Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/)

Also see [Python Packaging User Guide](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml)

Install hatch with `pipx` and configure it. As a minimum, configure it to create `venv` in your project folder:
```toml
[dirs.env]
virtual = ".venv"
```

# Releases
We release the package to a private package feed in ADO under "The Compass" project "compass" feed.

# Versioning
The package follows semantic versioning. Breaking changes will occur unannounced before `v1.0.0`. After that all breaking changes will lead to bumping the major version number.

# VSCode
1. Clone the repo
1. Run `hatch env create && hatch env create dev && hatch env create test`
1. Open VSCode `code .`
1. Select the `dev` environment for development [See the documentation.](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/how-to/integrate/vscode/)

To enable test discovery and test debugging, change the *python interpreter path* to a test environments path e.g. `test.py3.11`.

# No VSCode
I suggest NeoVim or Zed. See the cheat-sheet below.

# Cheat sheet
- tests: `hatch test`
- docs: `hatch run dev:docs`

# Documentation
The docs is built into "sites" folder. This is gitignored and the docs is built in CI.

The latest version of the documentation is available on a github pages site, linked in the github repo.

To preview the documentation locally, you need to start mkdocs server. See [Go to Cheat sheet](#cheat-sheet)  


# Releases
The project uses semantic versioning.

## Changelog Generation
## Update CHANGELOG and CONTRIBUTORS
`git-cliff` is used for changelog generation.

We do not separate between `developer` and `user` changelog/news. The changelog is directly pulled from your git commits. Hence, it is necessary to write commits according to conventional commits.
