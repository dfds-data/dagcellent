    Represents a version of a DAG and becomes a source of truth for a BackfillJob execution.

    Dags can originate from different places (user repos, main repo, ...) and also get executed
    in different places (different executors).  A pickle is a native python serialized object,
    and in this case gets stored in the database for the duration of the job.

    The executors pick up the DagPickle id and read the dag definition from the database.
